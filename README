bnapbnap project

------------------------------

The bnapbnap project was initially created by 
Joshua Wright (www.willhackforsushi.com) but it
was eventually shut down due to the release of 
newer techniques that can be used to recover 
UAP/NAP information. 

We're bringing this project back to life because 
it still has a place in the world, especially for 
those who don't own a ubertooth :)
